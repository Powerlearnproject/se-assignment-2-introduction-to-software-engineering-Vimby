Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. it involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is a disciplined approach to software development that aims to manage complexity, ensure quality, and support maintainability, often at the cost of increased process overhead. Traditional programming focuses more on the immediate task of writing code and solving problems, typically in a more informal and flexible manner.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
1) Requirements: It involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
2) Planning and design: This stage involves creating a comprehensive project plan.It involves creating project timelines, resource allocation and high level, detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3) implementantion: It involves writing code and building the software architecture and user interface.
4) Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meet quality standards and functional  requirements
5) Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers
6) Maintenance: It involves providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile: Agile emphasises small , iterative cycles where each iterative builds on the previous one, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement.
Waterfall: It is a linear approach where each phase  of development process must be completed before the next one begins.
Differences
1) Development approach- Agile is divided into small cycles or sprints, with each cycle producing  a potentially shippable product increment whilst Waterfall is sequential and linear, It follows a phase by phase approach where each phase must be completed before the next one begins.
2) Flexibility- Agile is highly flexible and adaptable to changes , whilst Waterfall are difficult to accomodate once the project is in progress.
3) Customer involvement- They is high level of customer engagements when using Agile whilst customer engagement is limited with Waterfall.
4) Project phases- The project phases are overlapping but Waterfall phases are non-overlapping and dinstinct.
5) Documentation- Agile focuses on lightweight and minimal documentantion whilst Waterfall focuses on extensive and thorough, detailed documentantion.
6) Testing-Agile focuses on continous testing throughout the development process whilst Waterfall testing occurs after implementation.
Waterfall can be preferred when the project is well understood , stable and unlikely to change whilst Agile is preferred when the project scope is likely to change due to evolving customer needs or market conditions.



What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements Engineering:
Is a systematic process used in software and systems engineering to define, document and maintain the requirements for a software  system or project. It involves eliciting, analysing, specifying , validating and managing requirements. 
-Elicitation is gathering requirements from stakeholders through various techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, observation, and document analysis.
-Analysis involves analysing and refining the elicited requirements to ensure they are clear, complete, consistent, and feasible.
Identifying conflicts, ambiguities, and gaps in the requirements and resolving them through stakeholder collaboration.
-Specification is documenting the requirements in a formal and structured manner. This includes creating requirements documents, user stories, use cases, and models.
-Validation involves verifying that the documented requirements accurately reflect the needs and expectations of stakeholders.
Conducting reviews, inspections, and validation sessions with stakeholders to ensure the requirements are correct and complete.
-Management is managing changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle. This involves tracking changes, assessing their impact, and ensuring that all stakeholders are aware of and agree to the changes.
Requirements engineering is important in ensuring that the final product meets stakeholder needs, aligns with business goals and is delivered on time and within budget.



Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Software Design Principles:
Modularity is a fundamental concept in software design that involves dividing a software system into distinct, self contained units called modules. 
Mantainability- it improves this by isolating changes to specific modules. If a bug or a new feature is required only the relevant module needs to be modified reducing the risk of errors in another parts of the system.
Scalability-Modular systems can de developed and deployed independently making scaling easier. New modules can be added without disrupting existing functionality.



Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Software testing involves verifying that software functions as intended and identifying any defects. It is conducted at different levels to ensure comprehensive evaluation of the system. Here are the main levels of software testing:
1. Unit Testing
Focuses on individual components or units of code, typically functions or methods within a class. It is conducted by developers during the coding phase. It verifys that each unit of code performs as expected.
2. Integration Testing
Tests the interactions between integrated units or components. It is conducted after unit testing and before system testing.
It is used to detect issues in the interaction between units and verify that combined units work together as expected. An example for integration is veryfing that an API correctly communicates with a database.
Types:
Big Bang: All components are combined at once and tested together.
Incremental: Components are integrated and tested one by one. Incremental can be further divided into top-down, bottom-up, and sandwich (hybrid) approaches.
3. System Testing
Tests the complete and integrated software application as a whole. It is conducted by a separate testing team after integration testing.
It is used to validate that the entire system functions according to requirements.
Types:
Functional testing, performance testing, security testing, etc.
An example for system testing is testing an e-commerce applicationâ€™s complete purchase workflow verifying that all system features, such as search, add to cart, and checkout, work correctly.
4. Acceptance Testing
 Is conducted to determine if the system meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment.Typically involves end-users or customers and is the final level of testing before release.
It validates that the software meets business needs and requirements and ensure the system is ready for real-world use.


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version Control Systems are essential tools in software development for managing changes, facilitating collaboration, maintaining history, and ensuring the integrity of the codebase. The importance of version control system includes:
Collaboration-Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously. 
History and Documentation-Version control systems keeps a detailed history of changes made to the codebase. 
Backup and Restore-Version control systems acts as a backup system. If code is lost or corrupted, previous versions can be restored from the VCS, ensuring data integrity and availability.
Branching and Merging- Developers can create branches to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Once changes are validated, they can be merged back into the main branch.
Tracking Changes-Every change is tracked and recorded. This helps in reviewing the changes, understanding the development progres, and ensuring accountability.
Conflict Resolution-Version control systems provides tools to handle conflicts when changes from different developers overlap. This ensures that changes are integrated smoothly.
Continuous Integration-Version control systems is integral to continuous integration pipelines, where code changes are automatically tested and integrated, improving code quality and reducing integration issues.
Examples of popular version control systems includes github, gitlab and bitbucket.
Github- helps software teams to collaborate and maintain the entire history of code changes. You can track changes in code, turn back the clock to undo errors and share your efforts with other team members.
Gitlab- It comes with a lot of handy features like an integrated project, a project website, etc. Using the continuous integration (CI) capabilities of GitLab, you can automatically test and deliver the code.


Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Project Management:
A software project manager is responsible for planning, executing, and closing software projects. Their role involves coordinating the efforts of the development team, managing resources, and ensuring that the project meets its objectives in terms of scope, time, and cost. They act as a bridge between stakeholders and the development team, ensuring clear communication and alignment with project goals.
Their key responsibilities are multifaceted, involving planning, resource management, communication, risk management, and quality assurance. They face challenges such as scope creep, resource constraints, time management, and stakeholder expectations. Successfully navigating these challenges requires a combination of technical knowledge, leadership skills, and effective communication. A project managerâ€™s ability to balance these responsibilities and address challenges directly impacts the success of software projects.



Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
